# cattle_identifier
we have developed C++ code that is able to detect every Cow ID`s.
we used matching algorithm for cattle detection
we have used orb and sift to find key points of images and Brute Force algorithm for matching.
We have used OpenCV in this project to implement key points and matching algorithms
